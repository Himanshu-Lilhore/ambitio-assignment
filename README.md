# Ambitio Assignment

In this project, I used React & Tailwind to replicate the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/tTzRAmK5ecyhwpLmP2Qxmn/Frontend-Assignment?node-id=0-1&p=f) provided for the assignment. The way I approached this implementation is I divided the whole webpage into sections such as header, hero and matrics sections and then I went on to write code for each section, I used Tailwind as well as basic CSS wherever needed. At the end, I made the code mobile responsive as well.
